# Spotipy was another Spotify automation attempt
###### It was also the name of the primary module powering it.
After learning how inadequate spotify's genre data was, I figured I could just do it by hand.
I mean, I had thousands of songs, so I figured it would coexist on my second monitor and monitor my playback. The ideal scenario was at any point while listening to a song, I could turn to the app, dictate a genre label or several that I considered fitting, and then the song would be automatically sorted into folders in my spotify account accordingly. This project wasn't finished.
