# My most recent Flask project
I've stripped the purple cats from the imgs directory, but aside from that, this is my personal blog/journal, or at least what's powering it. Actual writing and such is done in Obsidian, and my most recent change was to actually treat my obsidian vault as though it were a part of the content directory, although in hindsight maybe I could just maintain my vault within the content directory.

I lost the first iteration of this project and I've been able to reproduce it in about half a week, faster if you don't count working full time. Although, most of this effort was simply directing ChatGPT 'Do this' 'I don't like what you did there, make this change for that reason' and 'I've encountered this error'
