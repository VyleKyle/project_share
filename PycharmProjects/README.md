# My first real foray into developing with GPT.
I believe my first iterations of the Flask project may have taken place around a similar time, because there exists a simple test just rendering spotify embeds into a flask template. The SpotifAI file also references a `webLord`, being the flask server file.
This original flask project was ultimately lost to a system reinstall and a failure to properly backup projects. It felt really defeating at the time.

The contents of the pythonProject directory are my first attempts at automating gathering data from spotify, such as genre and playback data.
